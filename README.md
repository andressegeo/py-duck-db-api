# Introduction

## What is this about ?

This project is a Python library that you can add to one of your project, to have an autogenerated API to interact with your data from a SQL Database.
The syntax is Mongo like, and the API easy to connect to an web application.

## What Python version ?

This only works with Python 2.

## How does it work ?

Starting from a normalized SQL database, the library will read the definition of the tables in your database, and expose web services corresponding to them.

## What Database can I use ?

Currently, this project has been produced to work in a Google Cloud Platform environment, then the only database I care is MySQL.
But because SQL is now a standard, it should not be very hard to create alternative versions for PostgreSQL or Oracle.

## With what web framework ?

The classes in charge of the SQL transactions do not depend on any web framework, but I supply a flask blueprint in the library.

# How to use 

## Warning

This is a personnal project I've created for my personnal use. 

Be aware than everything is not perfect, and that I basicly implement a functionnality only when I need it.
Then, please consider this project like a version 0.1, far from a final version.

## How Can I use it in my project ?

First, you need to install it with a pip. :

```bash
pip install https://github.com/duckswitch/py-db-api.git@master
```

Then add the blueprint to your flask application :

```python
# Import flask
from flask import Flask
# Import lib dependencies
from db_api.blueprint import construct_db_api_blueprint
from db_api.db_connection import DBConnection
# Import SQL Driver
import MySQLdb

app = Flask(__name__)
# register the supplied blueprint
app.register_blueprint(
    construct_db_api_blueprint(
        db_driver=MySQLdb,
        db_host=u"127.0.0.1",
        db_user=u"username",
        db_passwd=u"myusernamepassword",
        db_name=u"mydatabase"
    ), 
    url_prefix=u'/api'
)

if __name__ == u"__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Use the web service

You can now do requests on the relative url : /api/db/[table-name]/

- GET for a select
- POST for an insert
- DELETE for a delete
- PUT for an update

Some Examples for this schema : 

![Alt text](/schemas/hours-count-schema.png?raw=true "Hours count app schema")

### List data (GET)

getting client "Dummy1 or Dummy2"

```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/api/db/user?filters=FILTERS
```
With FILTERS having this value : 
```javascript
{
    "$or": [
        {
            "client.name": "Dummy1"
        },
        {
            "clent.name": "Dummy2"
        }
    ]
}
```
